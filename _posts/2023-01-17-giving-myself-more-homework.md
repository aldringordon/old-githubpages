slightly lost my mind and enrolled in Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai course "Supervised Machine Learning"

i already regret it. its like $70 a month split into 3 courses and the first course is just like basic machine learning up till gradient descent

it wont hurt to go through it all again because the ai communities naming conventions are fucking bullshit so the exposure to the stupid names they give shit should be good
